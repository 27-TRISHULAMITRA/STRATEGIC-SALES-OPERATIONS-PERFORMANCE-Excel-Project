##  Business Problem

An e-commerce/retail operation needs a single view of how sales, delivery performance, and cancellations vary by region and product — to identify which regions/products drive revenue, where delivery is slow, and where cancellations are eroding sales.

---

##  Data Model

| Sheet | Description | Key Columns |
|---|---|---|
| Orders | Transaction-level order data | Order ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Region, Sale Price/Unit, Quantity, Total Amount, Payment Method, Delivery Status, Order/Delivery/Cancel Date |
| Product Master | Product catalog | Product ID, Product Name, Category, Cost Price, Description |
| Region Master | Regional sales targets | Region, Sales Target |
| Customer Master | Customer directory | Customer ID, Customer Name, Customer Type, City, State |

Orders is linked to the master tables using *XLOOKUP*, pulling in Product Name, Category, and Customer Name directly rather than relying on nested VLOOKUP/MATCH formulas.

---

## 🛠️ Analysis Workflow

### 1. Region-Wise Product Sales
Pivot table of Total Sales Amount by Region × Product Category, revealing *North (₹10,491)* as the top-performing region and *Electronics (₹15,209)* as the top category.

### 2. Delivery Status Breakdown
Orders split by status: 34 Delivered, 30 Cancelled, 36 In Transit (out of 100 total).

### 3. Regional Average Delivery Time
Calculated per order using =IF(Delivery Date<>"", Delivery Date - Order Date, "NA"), then averaged by region — *East (4.25 days)* was slowest, *South (3.33 days)* fastest.

### 4. Effective Sales & Revenue
- Effective Sales (delivered orders only) = *₹35,258* total revenue.
- *% of Fast Deliveries* = Fast ÷ (Fast + Slow) = *32.4%*.
- *Top 3 performing regions:* North (₹10,491), West (₹8,359), South (₹7,317).
- *Highest-selling product by revenue:* Smartphone (₹9,644).
- *Highest-selling product by units:* Leg Set & T-Shirt (tied, 8 units each).

### 5. Trend & Conditional Formatting
- Monthly Sales Trend line chart (Jan–Dec) — peak month: *November (₹6,312)*.
- Conditional formatting applied to flag late deliveries and cancelled orders directly in the Orders table.

### 6. Cancellation Analysis
Cancellation Rate by Region (Cancelled ÷ Total Orders):

| Region | Cancellation Rate |
|---|---|
| North | 40% |
| Central | 35.7% |
| West | 34.8% |
| South | 20% |
| East | 16.7% |

### 7. Consolidated Dashboard
All KPIs and charts combined into a single interactive DASHBOARD sheet for at-a-glance monitoring.

##  Key Business Insights

- *Electronics is the strongest category* — it generates the most revenue overall, driven primarily by Smartphones (₹9,644, the single highest-revenue product).
- *North region is a paradox:* it generates the highest revenue (₹10,491) but also the highest cancellation rate (40%) — pointing to strong demand alongside fulfillment/operational issues.
- *Only 32.4% of orders qualify as "fast" deliveries*, and only 11 of 100 orders were delivered within 2 days — delivery speed is a clear improvement area.
- *East, Central, and North regions have the highest average delivery times* (4.25, 4.2, and 3.63 days respectively) and should be prioritized for logistics improvements.
- *XLOOKUP significantly simplified cross-sheet analysis*, enabling direct two-way lookups without column-index limitations, improving formula accuracy and maintainability versus VLOOKUP + MATCH.

##  Recommendations

1. Reduce regional delivery delays, especially in North, East, and Central.
2. Optimize delivery routes and strengthen courier/fulfillment partnerships to cut cancellations.
3. Implement real-time shipment tracking to catch delays early.
4. Speed up warehouse dispatch processing to shorten total delivery time.
5. Investigate root causes of cancellations in high-cancellation regions (North, Central, West).
